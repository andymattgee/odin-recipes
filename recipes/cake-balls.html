        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. <br>
                Line a baking tray with waxed paper.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Blend cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer at low speed until moistened,<br>
                 about 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.<br>
                 Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                 <br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 26 to 31 minutes. <br>
                Let cool enough to handle.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Crumble warm cake into a large bowl; stir in frosting until well blended. <br>
                Use a melon baller or small scoop to form chocolate cake mixture into balls and place them on the prepared baking tray. <br>
                Place in the freezer until cake balls are chilled, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Melt chocolate coating in a glass bowl in the microwave or a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, <br>
                stirring occasionally until smooth.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Dip cake balls in melted chocolate using a toothpick or fork to hold them. <br>
                Return to the tray to set.</li>
